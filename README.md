# Feed Reader Testing

This is the 4th project of Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Programme. The starter code package for an RSS reader was provided to students, and they're required to understand the code, then write unit test suites for it.

## How to Run the Application

Open the `index.html` file, and wait for it to load. The test results can be found at the bottom of the page.
